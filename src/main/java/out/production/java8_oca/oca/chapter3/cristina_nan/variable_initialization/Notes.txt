- Instance variables are initialized to a default value each time a new instance is created, although they may be given an explicit value 
after the object's super constructors have completed.
- Default Values for Primitives and Reference Types
       Object Reference -> null(not referencing any object)
       byte, short, int, long -> 0
       float, double -> 0.0
       boolean -> false
       char -> '\u0000'
- Array elements are always, always, always given default values, regardless of where the array itself is instantiated.
