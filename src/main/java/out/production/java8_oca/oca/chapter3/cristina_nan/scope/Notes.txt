We have four basic scopes of variables:
- Static variables have the longest scope; they are created when the class is loaded, and they survive as long as the class stays loaded in the JVM
- Instance variables - they were created when a new instance is created, and they live until instance is removed
- Local variables - they live as long their method remains on the stack
- Block variables - live only as long as the code block is executing
