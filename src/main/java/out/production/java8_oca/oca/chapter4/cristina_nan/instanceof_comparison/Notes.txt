- instanceof operator is used for object reference variables only, and you can use it to check whether an object is of a particular type
- An object is said to be of a particular interface(meaning will pass the instanceof test), if any of the object's superclasses implement the interface
- Any object reference will be instanceof Object
- An array is always an instance of Object
