Liteterals - code representation of primitive data types;

Integer literals
----------------
Can be represented as base 16, base 10, base 8, or base 2
base 2 digits = {0, 1} - java representation ex: 0b10 or 0B10 or 0B1_0 
base 8 digits = {0 ,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - java representation ex: 075 or 07_5
base 10 digits = {0, 1, 2,3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} - java representation ex: 10 or 1_0
base 16 digits = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, a or A, b or B, c or C, d or D, e or E, f or F} - java representation ex: 0xAB or 0XAB or 0XaB or 0xAb or 0Xab or 0xA_B

Real Literals
-------------
Floating Point
Can be represented in base 10 or base 16;
Example: 12.2 (represented by default on 64 bits or of type double) 12.2f (32 bits or of type float)

Boolean Literals
----------------
true, false

Character literals
Can represent a single character provided in quotes.
Example: `a`

Literal values for strings
Can be represented as a string aray in quotes.

Example: "ABC"

Assignment operators:

= - used to assign a value to a valiable
  - the value can be a primitive or a reference to an object.
  - an object reference variable can hold a reference on an object of its type or any other of its subtypes;                       

Any operation on primitives returns an int;

byte a = 3;
byte b = 4;
byte c = a + b;
