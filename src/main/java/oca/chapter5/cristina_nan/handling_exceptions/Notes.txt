Catching an Exception using try and catch / using finally
- It is a illegal to use a try clause without either a catch clause or a finally clause. A try clause by itself will result in a compiler error
- Any catch clauses must immediately follow the try block
- Any finally clause must immediately  follow the last catch clause(or it must immediately follow the try block if there is no catch)
- It is legal to omit either the catch clause or the finally clause, but not both
